          I lectured about the
          <a href="https://jana-sotakova.github.io/research.html">Breaking the Decisional Diffie Hellman"</a>
          paper at the
          <a href="https://isogenyschool2020.co.uk/">Isogeny School</a>.
          Notes are available

        <li>
          I gave a talk at the student-organized ANTS summer school. My talk was on
            "Elliptic curves, isogenies, and endomorphism rings".

            The video is available on
            <a href="https://youtu.be/hHD1tqFqjEQ">Youtube</a>
             and the write-up is <a href='writings/ANTS_school_exposition.pdf'>here</a>
